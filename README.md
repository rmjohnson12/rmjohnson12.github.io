# About Me


## Interesting Info

I graduated from ncsu back in 2008 with a degree in mathematics. I've come back to school after being laid off by VMware because I'm having a really hard time finding a job and I know that there are more cyber security positions than there are people to fill them!

I love playing video games and my favorite game of all time has to be **The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time**

I also _really_ enjoy playing Magic the Gathering.


## Websites that I frequently use

* [National and local weather](https://weather.com)
I am a weather geek so the weather.com website is very useful to me and something that I visit daily. It has been particularly useful these last few days with the snow!

* [News and Observer](https://www.newsobserver.com)
I am also very interested in local news and the news and observer is pretty good for that kind of thing. And it also allows me to cross reference their weather data with the weather data from weather.com!
